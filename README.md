# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built a website where I can keep track of my notes on the different languages for coding.

- I wanted to get experience in building a website and becoming familiar with code.
- I built this website so I can keep track of some of the stuff I learned along the way.
- This website allows me to keep track of the notes I took while completing the prework.
- I learned a lot about CSS, HTML, Git, and Javascript. I also learned about pull requests and creating new branches.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The website allows for users to see the notes that I took when learning about coding and building the website. In addition to viewing what I have learned, users can open the DevTools console and see the JavaScript that was used. It shows what I learned and picks a topic to study.
